# Simple Event Registration System (SERS)

**A mini-project for the Software Configuration Management course**  
Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (AASTU)  
**Submitted: December 2025**

## Overview
SERS is a lightweight, client-side web application that allows users to browse upcoming events and register for them. It demonstrates core software configuration management principles through structured versioning, change control, branching, and baseline management using GitHub.

Built entirely with vanilla technologies --no frameworks or backend required.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login (username: `admin`, password: `123`)
- **Event Dashboard**: View detailed list of upcoming events with real-time seat availability
- **One-Click Registration**: Register for events; button disables on success or when full
- **Success Feedback**: Animated green banner confirms successful registration
- **My Registrations Section**: Personalized grid showing all your registered events
- **Seat Management**: Tracks remaining seats and marks events as "Full"
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with gradient background, cards, and smooth animations
- **Data Persistence**: Events loaded from `events.json`; user registrations stored in localStorage
